# Analysis-on-Real-Estate-Data-across-the-United-States

The U.S. government maintains thousands of buildings across the country, and effective management of these properties
requires understanding their geographical distribution, historical significance, accessibility compliance, and infrastructure gaps.
This project analyses the “Real Estate Across the United States (REXUS) Inventory (Building)” dataset 
to derive actionable insights for better infrastructure planning, maintenance, and accessibility improvements.

# Objectives

    •	Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, duplicates, standardize text, and parse dates.
    •	Analyse the geographic distribution of buildings by state, city, and county.
    •	Assess building ownership (Owned vs Leased) across states.
    •	Evaluate the compliance of buildings with ABA accessibility standards.
    •	Analyse the age of buildings and their historical designations.
    •	Identify and visualize buildings with no parking space.
    •	Explore and visualize the distribution of historical properties across different states.
