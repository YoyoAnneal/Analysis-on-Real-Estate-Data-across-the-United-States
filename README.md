# Analysis-on-Real-Estate-Data-across-the-United-States

The U.S. government maintains thousands of buildings across the country, and effective management of these properties requires understanding their geographical distribution, 
historical significance, accessibility compliance, and infrastructure gaps. This project analyses the “Real Estate Across the United States (REXUS) Inventory (Building)” dataset 
to derive actionable insights for better infrastructure planning, maintenance, and accessibility improvements.
